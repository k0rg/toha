Hi! I'm Brinton.

I've been working in tech for more than a decade and I've been a nerd for as long as I can remember. 

I mostly created this site to document some things I've learned along the way. This is also a place I keep some tutorials, walkthroughs, and references (mostly for me) that others might find useful.
